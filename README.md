a game about shrooms

## ideas
### **technical**
	local host online
	godot engine
### **mechanics**
	three primary gameplay phases spore, colonisation and fruiting
#### character
###### generation and evolution
	appearence affected by stats and traits
	starting strains affect appreance and traits
		Agaricus (button)
			small
		Hericium (lion's mane)
			dense?
		Pleurotus (oyster)
			basic			
###### stats	
  	vita (health)

  	viribus (strength)

		idea - morphic resonance - allows you to transform into objects in the environment and camoflage
###### trading
	exchange materials with roots to obtain sugars (could give achievment called "symbyosis")
###### phases
	spore
	colonisation
		materials consumed during this phase affect stats
		certain materials and environments will give special traits
	fruiting

### **design**
	mushroom theme
	procedurally generated caves make up most of gameplay besides initial stages
	game mechanics primarily learnt through discovery (also wiki)
	minimal/optional grind
	mystic comes from geodes
	interactive world (noita inspired)
	latin naming scheme as default
#### visual	
	customisable graphics
		texture packs
		shaders??
	Low poly
