# shroom_game
a game about shrooms by apk-lu and tadhg95

## ideas
### **technical**
	local host online
	godot engine
### **mechanics**
	morphic resonance
		learn blueprints for weapons that can be formed by the shroom at a resource cost
		recipes are passed down through generations of the strain
	three primary gameplay phases spore, colonisation and fruiting
#### character
###### generation and evolution
	appearence affected by stats and traits
	starting strains affect appreance and traits
		Agaricus (button)
			small
		Hericium (lion's mane)
			dense?
		Pleurotus (oyster)
			basic			
###### stats	
  	vita (health)
		related material - 
		effect on body - increases size
  	pignus (defense)
		related material - 
		effect on body - increases density
  	viribus (strength)
		related material - 
		effect on body - changes arms
  	mystic (magic)

		effect on body - 
  	finesse (dexterity)

  	motum (agility)

	traits
		will be set based on the environment or special materials during colonisation
###### trading
	exchange materials with roots to obtain sugars (could give achievment called "symbyosis")
###### phases
	spore
		fly around and find a place to germinate
	colonisation
		materials consumed during this phase affect stats
		certain materials and environments will give special traits
	fruiting
		the magority of the game where you run around and kill stuff idk

### **design**
	mushroom theme
	procedurally generated caves make up most of gameplay besides initial stages
	game mechanics primarily learnt through discovery (also wiki)
	minimal/optional grind
	mystic comes from geodes
	interactive world (noita inspired)
	latin naming scheme as default
#### visual	
	customisable graphics
		texture packs
		shaders?
#### audio
	mushroom music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmw-u-2kzPQPO5n9sTpcyA
